Development of Cost effective respiratory monitoring system with open source platform for measuring respiratory rate and breathing sounds. Securely monitoring and reporting patient information in real-time circumstances with cloud assistance. 

**Abstract:**

  In Asian countries, long term respiratory ailments are one of the multiple biggest killers of
illness and causalities in particular on a global level [1]. Anomalous conditions of respiratory
system embodies a group of disorders. Few of them are asthma, Chronic obstructive Pulmonary
Diseases (COPD), bronchitis and excessive pressure in ventilator system. Owing to excessive
exposure to atmospheric pollutants, air ways of pulmonary system collapses and among several
lung disorders, COPD is ranked high contributing to more than 3.23 million deaths [2] in the
year 2019. Furthermore, Global burden of Disease study recently reports that this type of
disorder lists in the top 10 accounting to approximately 32.8 lac deaths in the American
continents. Additional facts underline that more than 90% of such kind of disorder falls out in
impoverished nations with less and middle income [3].

Detecting the abnormalities in the lung sounds at an early stage is predominant in diagnosing
the orders. Some of the diagnostic approaches used for COPD requires examination that rely
upon auscultation and certain indicators. The most simple and cost effective diagnostic
mechanism used to listen to the breathe sounds is auscultation with the help of stethoscope [4].
Despite the fact it’s simple, the outcomes of diagnosis are less significant as this approach highly
depends on the expertise of medical practitioners.
Henceforth, it is mandatory
 To formulate a machine –driven diagnostic tool to provide quantitative results in order
to facilitate the clinicians in the accurate examination.
 Analogously, providing the utmost care to the patients suffering from respiratory
disorders living in remote areas are found to be promising.
To meet this challenges, a conglomeration of IoT, cloud computing and deep learning with smart
sensors are exploited to develop the smart respiratory monitoring system with AI for diagnosing
the respiratory disorders. 

**Methodology**

There are several methods available for measurements which include contact-based or
contactless. Discrimination of normal and adventitious respiratory sounds from stethoscope
auscultation by human ears is challenging owing to low frequency characteristics and varying
frequency range for inspiration and expiration. This model presents a survey of the contactbased methods for measuring respiratory rate. For this task, the sensing element BMP 280 and
Mic sensor is used. 

**Final outcome/deliverable of the project:**

 Development of Cost effective respiratory monitoring system with open source
platform for measuring respiratory rate and breathing sounds.

 Securely monitoring and reporting patient information in real-time circumstances
with cloud assistance.

 Expected to provide trustworthy deep learning model that provide transparent
explanations for the diagnostic decision during the course of COPD treatment.
